Multiple 'settings.py' files were found in your Django application:
[crowdfunding/crowdfunding/settings.py, venv/Lib/site-packages/rest_framework/settings.py]
It's not recommended to have multiple 'settings.py' files.
Instead, you can have a 'settings/' folder with the settings files according to the different environments (e.g., local.py, staging.py, production.py).
In this case, you can specify which settings file to use when running the Django application by setting the 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' environment variable to the corresponding settings file.

'STATIC_ROOT' setting was detected in 'crowdfunding/crowdfunding/settings.py'!
Static files will be collected during build time by running 'python manage.py collectstatic' on Dockerfile.

A default SECRET_KEY was not detected in 'crowdfunding/crowdfunding/settings.py'!
A generated SECRET_KEY "V351iyhSh54J8f4BIJ60FmID22ykhnZdO9FJPY4eXSEvrAX7Gb" was set on Dockerfile for building purposes.
Optionally, you can use django.core.management.utils.get_random_secret_key() to set the SECRET_KEY default value in your crowdfunding/crowdfunding/settings.py.
